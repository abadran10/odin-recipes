    <h2>This delicious flat iron steak was created from a combination of different recipes that I read. I combined, adjusted, and finally perfected the marinade and cooking time to my taste. I'm sure you will love it as well. After all, it is perfection!</h2>

    <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.

    Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.</p>

    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this foolproof flat iron steak:

    Marinate the steak in a resealable bag in the fridge for two to three hours. Sear the marinated steak in a hot skillet on both sides until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Discard the marinade and allow the meat to sit for a few minutes before digging in.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
        <li>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
